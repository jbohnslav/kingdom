# Backlog

* Prompt the agents to commit as they work, and update the ticket file manually with the work log.
* Make a "sherriff" of "bailiff" agent that watches the workers and make sure they continue working. They often just stop and ask the user, who just needs to say "continue".
* Make `ruff` and add pre-commit hooks
* Make a CI pipeline with github actions
