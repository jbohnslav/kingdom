# Contributing to Kingdom

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Getting Started

1. **File an issue first.** Before writing code, open an issue describing what you'd like to change and why. This lets us discuss the approach before you invest time.

2. **Fork and branch.** Work on a feature branch in your fork.

3. **Keep changes focused.** One logical change per PR. Small PRs are reviewed faster.

4. **Run tests.** Make sure `pytest` passes before opening a PR.

5. **Follow existing style.** Read the code around your change and match its conventions. See `CLAUDE.md` for project style guidelines.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. We're all here to build something useful.
