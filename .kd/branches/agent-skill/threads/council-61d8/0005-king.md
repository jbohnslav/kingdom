We've updated the design doc based on your feedback. Key changes: (1) The skill is now at skills/kingdom/ as a standalone directory with ZERO code — just SKILL.md + references/. The Python package (kd CLI) is installed separately via uv tool install kingdom. This matches the pattern from docx, pptx, pdf etc which all require external tool installation. (2) Root SKILL.md gets deleted. (3) No scripts/ directory. (4) Python 3.10+ not 3.12+. (5) Added Prerequisites section to body outline. (6) New open question: should PyPI package include skill files so kd install-skill could auto-setup? Read the updated design at .kd/branches/agent-skill/design.md and give your final thoughts. Any remaining issues or are we good to implement?
