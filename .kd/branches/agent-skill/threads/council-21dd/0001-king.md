kd tk show 6439. it'll show you a ticket. So increasing the timeout is trivial and we should do it, but I don't know to what extent the Streaming to file works right now. I think it might work a little bit, but I just want to make sure that if we get a timeout. The intermediate products that agents routinely create are captured there in that file. So that when we restart it or ask again, we can just say continue where you left off, and it like gets it. That'll save a ton of tokens.
