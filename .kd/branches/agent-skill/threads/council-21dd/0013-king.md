Read ticket cf85. then search the internet extensively and read in the uh skills submodule to find out how the open source, open specification, agent skills works, best practices and You might also want to look at some skills on ClawHub, but be warned because it's known that there are some Malicious skill files in there. What I want to know is the following: What is the skill specification? What are the best practices from the most popular skills? And how can we use that to turn Kingdom into a proper agent skill that we can install in any repo? and have agents easily do their work with this multi-agent council ticketing system that we've made?
