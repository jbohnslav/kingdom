We're about to open a PR for the agent-skill branch. Review the final implementation against the design doc and ticket acceptance criteria. Read: (1) .kd/branches/agent-skill/design.md (2) All closed tickets: 4cb3, 1be1, 3460, 41c4, b253, cf85 (3) The actual implementation: skills/kingdom/SKILL.md, skills/kingdom/references/*.md, tests/test_skill.py (4) The deleted root SKILL.md (confirm it's gone) (5) pyproject.toml requires-python change. Check: Are all acceptance criteria from cf85 met? Does the SKILL.md match the design doc's spec? Any gaps between what was planned and what was delivered? Do NOT modify any files.
