# Review agent skills spec and verify kd is installable as a skill

There's an open source agent skills specification that multiple agent platforms support (not just Claude Code). Review the spec to understand the format, registration, and invocation model. Then verify that `kd` commands can be exposed as skills — e.g. `/kd-status`, `/kd-council`, `/kd-peasant-start` etc. — so agents can use them naturally without raw bash commands. Test that at least one kd command is installable and invocable as a skill. Goal is to be agent-platform-agnostic, not tied to Claude Code's specific skill format.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Open source agent skills spec reviewed and documented (format, registration, discovery)
- [ ] Understand which agent platforms support it (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.)
- [ ] At least one kd command registered and working as a skill
- [ ] Document which kd commands make sense as skills vs staying as bash
- [ ] Notes on any limitations or gotchas
