# Create skills/kingdom/SKILL.md with spec-compliant frontmatter and body

Create skills/kingdom/SKILL.md with spec-compliant YAML frontmatter (name, description, compatibility) and markdown body. Body outline: (1) Prerequisites — uv tool install kingdom, verify with kd --help then kd doctor. (2) Core workflow — start → design → council → breakdown → tickets → work → done. (3) Command reference — concise table with correct signatures audited against --help. (4) Council philosophy — don't synthesize, let King read directly. (5) References — pointers to references/*.md. Keep under 500 lines, under 5000 tokens. One sentence of role framing max.

## Work Log

- Created `skills/kingdom/` directory and `skills/kingdom/references/`
- Wrote SKILL.md (138 lines) with spec-compliant frontmatter
- Audited all commands against `--help` output: kd, council, tk, peasant, design, breakdown
- Discovered peasant has 9 subcommands (start/status/logs/stop/clean/sync/msg/read/review) — more than design doc listed
- Organized command reference into 5 tables: Lifecycle, Design & Breakdown, Council, Tickets, Peasants
- Council guidelines section covers when to consult, when not to, and the "don't synthesize" rule
- Also downgraded pyproject.toml requires-python from >=3.12 to >=3.10 per King's request
