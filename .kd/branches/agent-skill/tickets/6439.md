# Increase council timeout to 10min and stream intermediate outputs

Two things: (1) Bump the default council timeout from whatever it is now to 10 minutes — long council discussions shouldn't time out prematurely. (2) Stream intermediate council outputs to file as they arrive, so if a subsequent message is sent (or the process restarts), it can pick up from where it left off rather than starting the full timeout clock from scratch. Check if we're already writing intermediates to disk — if so, wire up the resume logic; if not, add the streaming-to-file plumbing first.
