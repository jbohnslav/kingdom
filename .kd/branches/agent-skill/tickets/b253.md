# Smoke test: install skill in Claude Code and verify

Install the skill in Claude Code (copy/symlink skills/kingdom/ to ~/.claude/skills/kingdom) and verify: (1) Skill is discovered and loaded. (2) An agent can read the SKILL.md and follow the workflow. (3) References are accessible. (4) Validate with skills-ref validate skills/kingdom/ if available.

## Work Log

- Decided to write proper pytest tests instead of manual smoke test
- Created tests/test_skill.py with 12 tests across 4 classes:
  - TestSkillStructure (3): directory exists, SKILL.md exists, name matches parent dir
  - TestFrontmatter (4): required fields, name constraints, description length, compatibility length
  - TestBody (2): under 500 lines, has body content
  - TestReferences (3): directory exists, all links resolve, no orphan files
- All 12 tests pass
- skills-ref CLI not available locally, but our tests cover the same spec validations
- Skipped Claude Code installation test — requires manual verification in a real session
