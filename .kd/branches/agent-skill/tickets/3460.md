# Create skills/kingdom/references/ files (council, tickets, peasants)

Create reference files for progressive disclosure. Extract detailed docs from the current SKILL.md and expand as needed: (1) references/council.md — council usage patterns, when to consult, async vs sync, --to for targeted queries, thread watching, don't synthesize philosophy. (2) references/tickets.md — ticket lifecycle, commands, statuses, dependencies, backlog management. (3) references/peasants.md — peasant/worktree workflow. If peasants.md ends up under ~40 lines, fold it into SKILL.md body instead. Each file should be self-contained and not duplicate SKILL.md content.

## Work Log

- Created council.md (69 lines): querying patterns, threads, async/streaming, sessions, "don't synthesize" rule
- Created tickets.md (73 lines): state machine, creating/working/deps/assignment/backlog, best practices
- Created peasants.md (53 lines): worktree vs hand mode, managing/communication/lifecycle, kd work
- All three justified as separate files (53-73 lines each, well above the 40-line threshold)
- Content doesn't duplicate SKILL.md body — SKILL.md has the concise reference tables, these have the deep dives
