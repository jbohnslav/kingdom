# Delete root SKILL.md and update references

Delete the root SKILL.md (non-compliant prototype). Update CLAUDE.md if it references the old location. Check for any other references to root SKILL.md in docs or config that need updating. Ensure no dangling references in the same PR.

## Work Log

- Deleted root SKILL.md
- Checked CLAUDE.md — no references to SKILL.md, no update needed
- Checked docs/ — docs/cli-skill-architecture.md and docs/third_party/skills.md mention SKILL.md generically but in the context of the spec, not pointing to the root file. No updates needed.
- No dangling references found
