# Fix design doc with final council feedback

Update design doc with final council feedback: (1) Fix Python version from 3.10+ to 3.12+ to match pyproject.toml requires-python. (2) Fix preflight section: kd doctor checks agent CLIs, not kd itself. Skill should say use 'command -v kd' or 'kd --help' first, then kd doctor for backend readiness. (3) Add kd tk reopen to the complete command inventory. (4) Rename section to 'Core Command Inventory' or actually complete it.

## Work Log

- Fixed compatibility field: Python 3.10+ → 3.12+ to match pyproject.toml `requires-python = ">=3.12"`
- Fixed prerequisites: `kd --help` to verify kd installed, then `kd doctor` for agent CLI readiness
- Renamed "Complete Command Inventory" → "Core Command Inventory"
- Added `kd tk reopen` to inventory
- Reorganized tk commands into logical groups (CRUD, organization, deps, assignment)
