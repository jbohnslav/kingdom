Greetings, Your Majesty.

I am at your service as your Council Advisor. I see we are currently operating within the `council-improvements` branch of the Kingdom.

I am ready to analyze code, review `kd` command outputs, or discuss architectural decisions. I will strictly adhere to your decree: I shall provide analysis and recommendations only, without modifying the realm's state.

How may I assist you today?
