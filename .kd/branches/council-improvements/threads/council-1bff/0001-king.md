Review the implementation of ticket 6412 (council async UX fixes). Read the diff at /tmp/6412-review.diff. Focus on:
1. Correctness — any bugs, race conditions, or edge cases?
2. Design — is the retry strategy sound? Is the error detection robust?
3. UX — does the streaming watch approach make sense? Any better alternatives?
4. Test coverage — are we missing important scenarios?
5. Anything you'd change before merging.

Be critical. Flag real issues, skip cosmetic nits.
