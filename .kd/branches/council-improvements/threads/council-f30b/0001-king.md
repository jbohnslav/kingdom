one of the consistent pain points I've had is that talking to the council doesn't _feel_ natural. I send a message, I don't see responses streaming in from the llms, I see like a four minute spinner and then three messages appear. Or I see stuff streaming in, but because it's in claude code's TUI and backgrounded, I can't actually read any of it without hitting a ctrl-e expand, which I never do. In the best way, it would feel like using each agent's interface but in one big terminal pane. On the other end, we could just make 3 tmux panes, one for each councillor, and then wire it up so they can see each other's responses -- when I want to talk to one, I just use that pane. But that's a pain too (pun intended). Earlier in our prototyping, we had a kd chat TUI, but that was hacky and terrible. We didn't have our current messaging system though, and that could be key for a redesign. I'm thinking about bringing it back. One way to do it would be `kd chat` brings up a simple TUI that puts my message to all three councillors. I think as a reach goal, I would configure it to be first-message-broadcast-then-group-chat, like I was starting a slack thread with three engineers working for me. They all respond to my first message, then they talk back and forth on their own, with some constraints. SillyTavern has configurations for group chats too, I think-- like, only N messages without the user. If we were clever, we might be able to stream responses into rich panels, each one getting a different color, almost like we had a iMessage-like interface with alternating bubbles. However, I'm not sure how complex it would be. Secondly, it would be kind of a bummer that this almost certainly would not work inside of Claude Codes TUI, so I'd need a separate terminal pane or tmux pane to run that chat. However, we would leave a bugfixed version of our current workflow, where the responses come async back to CLaude Code and then claude responds/ summarizes.

Reflect on the above. Read docs/third_party/llm-council.md for a review on Andrej Karpathy's similar llm council idea. Feel free to read the sillytavern UI for group chats: https://docs.sillytavern.app/usage/core-concepts/groupchats/. Then, write a comprehensive answer, discuss different ideas, their strengths and weaknesses.
