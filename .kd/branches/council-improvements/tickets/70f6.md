# council show should paginate: show recent messages by default, --all for full history

## Problem

`kd council show <thread-id>` dumps the entire thread history. The config-system review thread hit 2195 lines / 30 messages — that's a huge token cost when an agent just wants to see the latest responses. Most of the time you only care about the most recent conversational turn (the last query + all responses to it).

## Proposal

- Default: show only the most recent turn (last king message + all member responses to it)
- `--last N`: show the last N messages
- `--all`: show the full thread history
- Always show a summary line at the top like "Showing last turn (3 of 30 messages). Use --all for full history."

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `kd council show <id>` defaults to showing only the latest turn
- [ ] `kd council show <id> --last N` shows the last N messages
- [ ] `kd council show <id> --all` shows the full thread
- [ ] Summary line indicates how many messages are hidden
