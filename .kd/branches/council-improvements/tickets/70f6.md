# council show: paginate by turns with visual separation

## Problem

`kd council show <thread-id>` dumps the entire thread history as a flat list with no visual boundaries. The config-system review thread hit 2195 lines / 30 messages — that's a huge token cost when an agent just wants to see the latest responses. Most of the time you only care about the most recent conversational turn (the last query + all responses to it). Multi-turn threads are hard to scan without visual separation.

## Proposal

- A "turn" = one king message + all member responses before the next king message
- Default: show only the most recent turn
- `--last N`: show the last N turns (not messages)
- `--all`: show the full thread history
- Clear visual separators between turns (horizontal rules, turn headers with turn number and timestamp)
- Summary line at the top like "Showing last turn (3 of 30 messages). Use --all for full history."

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `kd council show <id>` defaults to showing only the latest turn
- [ ] `kd council show <id> --last N` shows the last N turns
- [ ] `kd council show <id> --all` shows the full thread
- [ ] Summary line indicates how many messages/turns are hidden
- [ ] Clear visual separator (horizontal rule or similar) between conversational turns
- [ ] Each turn has a header showing turn number and timestamp
- [ ] Works with both `--all` and default (latest turn) display modes

Note: Subsumes former ticket d09d (visual turn separation).
