# kd council list should show member response status and topic summary

## Description

`kd council list` currently shows thread IDs with no context. Enrich it to show per-member response status (responded/pending/errored) and the first line of the king's prompt as a topic summary so you can tell threads apart at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Each thread row shows per-member response status (responded, pending, errored)
- [x] Each thread row shows first line of the king's prompt as topic summary (truncated)
- [x] Status derived from thread message files: presence = responded, absence = pending. Errored state detected by checking if the response body is short and matches an error pattern (e.g. starts with `Error:` or contains only an error message with no substantive content)
- [x] Tests cover listing with mixed member states

## Worklog

Implementation:
- Rewrote `council_list` to use Rich console output with per-thread blocks
- Each thread shows: ID, created timestamp, current-thread marker
- Topic: first line of the first king message, truncated to 60 chars
- Per-member status using `thread_response_status()` with symbols: ✓ responded, ○ running, ✗ errored, ⏖ timed_out, … pending
- Reuses the existing rich member state model from a9c9
- Added `ls` as an alias for `council list`
- 4 new tests (topic summary, member status, mixed states, errored member), replaced old message-count test
