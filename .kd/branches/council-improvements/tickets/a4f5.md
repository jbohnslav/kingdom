# kd council list should show member response status and topic summary

## Description

`kd council list` currently shows thread IDs with no context. Enrich it to show per-member response status (responded/pending/errored) and the first line of the king's prompt as a topic summary so you can tell threads apart at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each thread row shows per-member response status (responded, pending, errored)
- [ ] Each thread row shows first line of the king's prompt as topic summary (truncated)
- [ ] Status is derived from thread message files (presence = responded, absence = pending, error field = errored)
- [ ] Tests cover listing with mixed member states
