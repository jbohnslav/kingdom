# kd tk show renders raw YAML frontmatter — should display structured header instead

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Ticket metadata displayed as structured header (id, status, priority, type)
- [x] No raw YAML frontmatter or `---` delimiters in output
- [x] Deps, links, assignee shown on separate lines when present
- [x] Status color-coded (yellow=open, cyan=in_progress, green=closed)
- [x] Also fixes 748c (metadata crammed on one line)

## Worklog

Replaced raw `ticket_path.read_text()` + Markdown rendering with structured output:
- Parsed Ticket fields rendered as a clean header block
- Rule separator between file path and metadata
- Body rendered as Markdown without frontmatter
- 2 new tests: structured header, no raw frontmatter
