# kd council show needs visual separation between conversational turns

## Description

`kd council show` renders all messages as a flat list with no visual boundaries between turns. A "turn" is a king message plus all member responses to it. Add clear visual separators (horizontal rules, turn headers with turn number and timestamp) so multi-turn threads are scannable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clear visual separator (horizontal rule or similar) between conversational turns
- [ ] Each turn has a header showing turn number and timestamp
- [ ] A "turn" = one king message + all member responses before the next king message
- [ ] Works with both `--all` and default (latest turn) display modes from 70f6
