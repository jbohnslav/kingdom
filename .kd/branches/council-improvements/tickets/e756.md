# Switch council to stream-json and build NDJSON parsing for live streaming

## Description

Phase 0 foundation work. The council currently uses `--output-format json` for Claude Code and Cursor, which buffers all output until process exit. Both CLIs support `--output-format stream-json` which emits NDJSON (one JSON object per line) as tokens arrive. Switching to stream-json makes `.stream-{member}.jsonl` files genuinely useful for live display.

This ticket covers the plumbing — command builder changes, NDJSON parsers, and stream-line extractors. Consuming the stream files (watch, TUI) is in separate tickets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `build_command()` gains a `streaming=True` parameter; when set, Claude uses `--output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages` and Cursor uses `--output-format stream-json` instead of `--output-format json`
- [ ] Council query path (`CouncilMember.query()`) passes `streaming=True` to build_command
- [ ] Stream files renamed from `.stream-{member}.md` to `.stream-{member}.jsonl`
- [ ] `parse_claude_response()` handles NDJSON stdout: joins text from `text_delta` events, extracts session_id from result event
- [ ] `parse_cursor_response()` handles NDJSON stdout: joins text from delta events, extracts session_id
- [ ] New `extract_stream_text(line, backend)` function: given a single NDJSON line, returns the human-readable text fragment (if any) for real-time display
- [ ] Codex parser unchanged (already NDJSON-shaped)
- [ ] Existing tests updated; new tests cover NDJSON parsing for Claude and Cursor
- [ ] Non-streaming paths (peasant workers) still use `--output-format json` by default
