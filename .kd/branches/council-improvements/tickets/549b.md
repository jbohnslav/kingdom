# Allow council to run with Claude Code and exclude Codex

Add support to configure council members so teams can run council with Claude Code while excluding Codex when Codex is unavailable or undesired.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Council member selection can be configured without code changes (project config or agent config).
- [x] A configuration that includes Claude and excludes Codex is supported and documented.
- [x] `kd council ask` runs successfully with the configured member set and does not attempt to invoke Codex.
- [x] Existing setups continue to work unless explicitly reconfigured.
