# kd tk list should hide closed tickets by default (add --include-closed to show them)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `kd tk list` hides closed tickets by default
- [x] `kd tk list --include-closed` shows all tickets
- [x] `kd tk list --all` also hides closed by default
- [x] `--backlog` already filtered closed (no change needed)
- [x] Tests cover default, --include-closed, and --all paths

## Worklog

Added `--include-closed` flag to `ticket_list()`. Filters closed tickets in both
the default (current branch) and `--all` paths. Backlog path already filtered.
3 tests added to TestTicketList.
