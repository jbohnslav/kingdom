/Users/jrb/code/kingdom/.kd/branches/peasant-worktree-optional/design.md what if we had a uh command that was like KD ticket execute or KD work ticket or whatever we decide and That more or less launched a Ralph loop. And so then, if you did that. In the hand, then the hand would do the ticket. And if you did that in a peasant work tree asynchronously, then the peasant would do the ticket.
