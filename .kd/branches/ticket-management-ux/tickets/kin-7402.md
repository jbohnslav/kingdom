# Simplify ticket create to return path for follow-up editing

Currently kd tk create requires stuffing the entire ticket body into CLI flags (-d), which is awkward for agents and humans alike. Instead, create should accept just the title, create the ticket file, and return the path. The caller (agent or human) can then edit the file directly to add description, acceptance criteria, etc. This matches how kd design works - create the file, return the path, edit separately.
