Updated design at .kd/branches/cli-output-cleanup/design.md. Key change from round 1: we're KEEPING Rich Markdown rendering, only dropping Panel. The pattern is: instead of Panel(Markdown(body), title='claude'), we do Markdown(f'## claude\n\n{body}'). This keeps nice formatted output for humans while eliminating box-drawing chars that pollute agent context. Console stays for Markdown, Tables, and Spinners. Any concerns with this revised approach? Anything we're missing?
