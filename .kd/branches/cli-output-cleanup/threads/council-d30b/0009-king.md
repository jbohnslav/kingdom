Review the implementation on cli-output-cleanup branch. Run 'git diff master...HEAD -- src/ tests/' mentally. Key changes: (1) All 11 Panel usages replaced with Markdown() + ## headers, raw output in fenced code blocks. (2) 'runs' → 'session' in user-facing strings + state.py. (3) Per-line whitespace stripping in thread.add_message(). (4) kd tk move defaults to current branch. (5) Relative paths in kd design/tk create. (6) File path shown in kd tk show. (7) doctor() simplified. All 459 tests pass, ruff clean. Any issues or missed edge cases?
