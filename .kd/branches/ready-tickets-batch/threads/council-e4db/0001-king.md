We currently use 4-char lowercase hex ticket IDs (e.g., 48f3). This gives only 65,536 IDs and may collide as usage grows. Please give your recommendation on ticket ID format. Evaluate these options: (A) keep 4-char hex only, (B) move to 6-char hex only, (C) use human-readable slug + hex like fix-ticket-id-48f3 or fix-ticket-id-a1b2c3. Consider uniqueness/collision risk, ergonomics in CLI usage, parsing complexity, backward compatibility with existing tickets, and implementation simplicity. Please provide: 1) preferred format, 2) exact migration strategy, 3) parsing/validation rules, 4) risk tradeoffs.
