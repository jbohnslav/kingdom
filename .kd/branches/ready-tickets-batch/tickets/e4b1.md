# Add kd status command showing agent workload and ticket assignments

Add a kd status command that shows what the current agent is working on and a broader view of all ticket assignments. Should integrate with kd whoami to know the current role, then show: which tickets are assigned to me, their status, and file locations. Optionally show a dashboard view of all agents and their assigned tickets. The assignment infrastructure (assignee field, kd tk assign/unassign) already exists — this is the query/display side.

## Implementation Notes (council)

**Key files:** `src/kingdom/cli.py` (status command ~L1811-1900), `src/kingdom/session.py`, `src/kingdom/ticket.py`

**Approach:**
- Extend existing `status` command or add a subcommand (`kd status --agents` or `kd agent status`)
- Use `whoami` logic (from 2819) to resolve current role
- List tickets assigned to current agent (filter `list_tickets()` by assignee field), show status and paths
- For dashboard view, iterate all session files and tickets, group by assignee

**Gotchas:**
- `kd status` already exists (shows branch info) — be careful not to break its current output
- The assignee field on tickets and `kd tk assign/unassign` commands already exist
- Depends on 2819 (whoami) for "who am I" resolution
- Consider: flag on status vs. separate subcommand
