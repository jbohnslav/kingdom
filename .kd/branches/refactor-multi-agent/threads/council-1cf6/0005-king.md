read .kd/branches/refactor-multi-agent/design.md. I'm having trouble figuring out how to make Claude Code's text user interface interact nicely with the council. I want to basically feel like We can ask the council and see the responses without clawed code needing to intervene or take over, or run two separate commands where I should. Show it second. How can we do this?
