Review the implementation of ticket 3b76 — auto-turn round-robin scheduler. Focus on the changes to these files:

1. src/kingdom/council/council.py — added auto_rounds and mode fields
2. src/kingdom/config.py — changed auto_rounds validation to allow 0
3. src/kingdom/tui/app.py — generation counter, refactored send_message(), new run_chat_round() coordinator
4. tests/test_tui.py — 10 new auto-turn tests
5. tests/test_config.py — updated validation test

Key design decisions to evaluate:
- Single coordinator coroutine (run_chat_round) instead of N independent workers
- Generation counter for preemption detection (separate from interrupted flag)
- Directed messages (to != 'all') skip auto-turns entirely
- WaitingPanels for auto-turns mounted inside the coordinator between awaits
- auto_rounds=0 allowed in config to disable auto-turns

Look for bugs, race conditions, missing edge cases, and UX issues.
