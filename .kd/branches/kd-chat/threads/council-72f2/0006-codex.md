Let’s run this like a mini design review so you get useful disagreement fast.

Share these 4 items:
1. goal (what must be true when we’re done)
2. constraints (time, risk, compatibility, etc.)
3. current approach (or top 2 options)
4. what decision you want today

I’ll pressure-test for failure modes and hidden complexity.
