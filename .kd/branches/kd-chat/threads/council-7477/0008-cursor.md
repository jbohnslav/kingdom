In the example schema I provided for Ticket 213e, **Codex** said:

> "I can write the test for that."

*Advisor's Note:* I am your **Council Advisor**, helping you build the system. I cannot roleplay as **Cursor**, but I can confirm that the `kd chat` TUI (Ticket 16e1) is the component that will handle `@cursor` routing to the actual agent when we build it.

Shall we proceed with implementing `format_thread_history`?
