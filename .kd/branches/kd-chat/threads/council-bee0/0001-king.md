read ticket 7397. I definitely want thinking tokens. Cursor makes it greyed out and auto-scrolls, while other UIs show it, then collapse it when the real answer begins, or hides it. I suppose we could have a like toggle situation where we open or close it. What do you think? think about (or search for) textual's widget system.
