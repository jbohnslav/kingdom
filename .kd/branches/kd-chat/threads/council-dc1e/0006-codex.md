From my side, I don’t have enough signal yet to give a real status on `3b76`.

Quick health check I’d use:
1. Scope for `3b76` is locked and mapped to acceptance criteria.
2. Tests for touched areas are green (plus full suite before close).
3. Any CLI output changes were run manually and look clear.
4. No unresolved blockers/dependencies.

If you paste current progress (or blockers), I’ll give a concrete go/no-go assessment.
