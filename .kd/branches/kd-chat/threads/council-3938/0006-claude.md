## The Greeting

> "To be goofy, or not to be goofy — that is never the question."
>
> — *William Goofspeare*

Hello, Your ***Most Royal Majesty***. You have summoned the markdown, and the markdown has **answered**.

## A Comprehensive Analysis

| Category | Rating | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|

### A Nested List, Because Why Not

1. First level
   - Second level
     - Third level
       - We've gone too deep
         - *There is no going back*
           - `help`

## Code Block (For No Reason)

```python
def respond_to_king(mood: str) -> str:
    if mood == "goofy":
        return "🎪" * 42
    raise NotGoofyEnoughError("Insufficient goofiness detected")
```

## In Conclusion

I believe **cursor** and **codex** will now feel *professionally obligated* to match this energy, and I look forward to watching them try.
