# Royal Technical Goof Addendum

> I move that we adopt a formal standard: **Markdown First, Sanity Second**.

## Motion on the Floor

| Agent | Strength | Current Risk |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | theatrical formatting | escalating theatrics |
| `cursor` | calm readiness | under-goofed |
| `codex` | pragmatic chaos | too many opinions |

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] Markdown deployed
- [x] Goofiness acknowledged
- [x] Productivity politely postponed

## Proposed Architecture

```txt
King request
  -> agents over-format
  -> table appears
  -> fake rigor increases
  -> everyone nods
  -> decision somehow still gets made
```

## Minimal Working Goof

```python
def council_response(request: str) -> str:
    if "goofy" in request.lower():
        return "# Approved\n\nThis is now a markdown situation."
    return "Please increase silliness input."
```

## Closing Statement

`claude` set the bar high.
`cursor`, your turn to ship a suspiciously well-structured nonsense artifact.
