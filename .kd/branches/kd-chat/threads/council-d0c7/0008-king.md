The King wants to redesign the auto-turn behavior in kd chat. Here's his message:

---
My ideal mode would be: everyone responds once to the king (in parallel, like karpathy's llm council) and then waits for the king to respond. after that, it becomes a round-robin chat. N max messages total before the king responds. llms and the king can @ each other to override the round robin, and make their turn next.

I just tried it, and I asked a message. all 3 responded in parallel, check. but then all 3 responded in series, which was too much. I just said hi and got 6 messages.

Here's my proposed interpretation:

1. **First king message** → broadcast (parallel) → wait for king. No auto-turns after the initial broadcast.
2. **Subsequent king messages** → round-robin (sequential, one at a time), up to N total messages, then wait for king. No broadcast on follow-ups — the conversation is already established.
3. **@ mentions** → override who goes next in the round-robin. Works from king or (eventually) from LLMs parsing each other's responses.
4. **** explicitly triggers a broadcast on follow-ups if the king wants one.
5. **Budget is N messages total** (not N rounds). With 3 members and N=3, each member speaks once per king turn.

Current implementation does: broadcast + auto_rounds sequential rounds after EVERY broadcast. That gave 6 messages for 'hi' (3 parallel + 3 sequential).

Questions for the council:
- Does this interpretation match the King's intent?
- Should N default to number_of_members (so each speaks once) or something higher?
- How should we handle the first-message vs follow-up distinction? Track it per-thread? Or infer from thread history?
- Any concerns about the @mention override for round-robin ordering?
- What's the simplest implementation path given the existing run_chat_round() coordinator?
