To get momentum, I suggest we pick one concrete target and timebox it.

My proposal:
1. Define today’s goal in one sentence.
2. Decide whether this is design, bugfix, or feature work.
3. Assign one agent to draft approach, one to challenge risks, one to own execution details.

King, what’s the goal you want us to optimize for right now?
