Review the integration test suite we just built for ticket cf1a. Read tests/test_tui_integration.py and the ticket at .kd/branches/kd-chat/tickets/cf1a.md. Evaluate: (1) Are the 22 tests covering all 11 scenarios well? Any gaps or scenarios we missed? (2) Is the FakeMember/harness approach solid or are there fragility risks? (3) Is the test isolation adequate (tmp_path, no shared state)? (4) Any improvements worth making now vs deferring? Be specific and concrete.
