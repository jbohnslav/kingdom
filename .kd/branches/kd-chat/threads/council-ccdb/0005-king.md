It's interesting, because I started to keep the messaging component of kingdom as simple as possible, but now it seems like we've wound up right back at "threads." Right now I have 3 panels open, one agent to file backlog tickets with my ideas as they come up, one executing code, and one council. Is there a bigger rethink of our threads / messaging system that would improve or simplify things? I don't want to work on this for 6 months and end up reimplementing IRC or something.
