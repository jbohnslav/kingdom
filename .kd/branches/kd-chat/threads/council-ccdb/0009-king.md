I think Cursor is closest to correct. I didn't say my three-panel thing as like, my core problem, just an example of the fact that my workflow with Kingdom is not 1000% perfected yet. Maybe once we have the peasant loop finished better, and the permissions for the Council better scoped, then the council basically dispatches peasants, checks on them, makes backlog tickets for me, etc.
