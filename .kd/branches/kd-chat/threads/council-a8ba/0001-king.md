review the design doc (kd design). at the end of this branch, I want a nice TUI to be able to persistently talk to the councillors, and have it be like a group chat with my best engineers. Does this design doc lay out a good plan to implement this feature? what is missing? what is incorrect? what key decisions should we make up front?
