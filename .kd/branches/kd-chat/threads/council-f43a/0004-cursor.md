Hello. I am at your service. We are currently working on the `kd-chat` TUI implementation.

To recap our status:
1.  **Design**: Approved and largely implemented.
2.  **Tickets**: Most Phase 1 tickets are closed, but I recommended reopening `16e1` (persistence) and `fe84` (polling) due to critical bugs found in the code review.
3.  **Next Steps**: Fix the message persistence and polling logic, then move on to the auto-turn scheduler.

How would you like to proceed?
