# Phase 1 end-to-end smoke test

## Context

Dogfooding pass before Phase 2 work begins. Verify the full Phase 1 TUI lifecycle works end-to-end. File bugs found as new tickets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Open TUI with `kd chat --new`, see empty layout with header, input area, status bar
- [ ] Type a message, hit Enter — see WaitingPanels appear for all members
- [ ] See WaitingPanel → StreamingPanel → MessagePanel lifecycle for each member
- [ ] Open existing thread with `kd chat <id>`, see full history rendered
- [ ] `@member` directed message sends only to that member
- [ ] Run `kd council ask --async` externally, open TUI — see in-flight streams picked up
- [ ] `kd council show` displays messages sent from the TUI correctly
- [ ] Error cases: missing agent CLI shows error panel, not crash
- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Any bugs found filed as new tickets

## Worklog
- 2026-02-15: Reopened after council QA. Phase 1 smoke criteria not actually met due two regressions discovered post-close: (1) TUI-run queries do not persist finalized member responses to thread files, (2) poller suppresses later stream updates after first finalized response.
