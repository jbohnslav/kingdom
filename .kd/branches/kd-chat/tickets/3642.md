# Slash commands: /mute, /unmute, /help, /quit

## Context

Slash commands for session-scoped TUI control. Split from 16e1 (input/dispatch) for independent testability. These are ephemeral UI state — resets when TUI closes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/mute <member>` excludes member from future queries (saves tokens, session-scoped)
- [ ] `/unmute <member>` re-includes member in queries
- [ ] `/help` shows available commands and keybindings
- [ ] `/quit` or `/exit` cleanly shuts down (waits for current generation if any)
- [ ] Unknown slash commands show error message, don't crash
- [ ] Mute list respected by query dispatch (muted members skipped in broadcast)
