# Configurable preamble: move COUNCIL_PREAMBLE to config

## Context

The hardcoded `COUNCIL_PREAMBLE` restricts agents to read-only advisory. For the "best engineers" chat experience, users should be able to customize this via `council.preamble` in config.json.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `CouncilMember.build_command()` reads preamble from `council.preamble` config instead of hardcoded `COUNCIL_PREAMBLE`
- [ ] Default value matches current `COUNCIL_PREAMBLE` text (backward compatible)
- [ ] Per-agent `agents.<name>.prompts.council` remains additive (appended after preamble), not a replacement
- [ ] Prompt merge order: preamble + phase prompt + agent prompt + user prompt
- [ ] Existing council behavior unchanged when `council.preamble` is not set in config
- [ ] Test: custom preamble propagates into the built command's prompt
