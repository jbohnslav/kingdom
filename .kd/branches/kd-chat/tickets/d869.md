# Escape interrupt: kill TUI-launched subprocesses

## Context

Escape key kills all currently-generating subprocesses launched by this TUI process and cancels pending auto-turns. Uses `member.process.terminate()` from the Popen handle stored on CouncilMember.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Escape key binding in ChatApp triggers interrupt handler
- [ ] Interrupt handler calls `member.process.terminate()` on all members with active subprocesses
- [ ] Only kills queries launched by this TUI process (checks `member.process` is not None)
- [ ] Prevents next auto-turn from scheduling (sets interrupt flag)
- [ ] StreamingPanel for interrupted members shows interrupted state (not stuck as "streaming")
- [ ] Second Escape during `/quit` forces immediate exit
- [ ] Does not crash if no queries are running when Escape is pressed
