# Render thinking tokens in kd chat stream

## Context

Cursor stream JSON includes `thinking` events before assistant text, but `kd chat`
currently ignores them and only renders assistant text deltas. This makes Cursor
appear idle for long periods even though stream activity exists.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add configurable support for rendering thinking/reasoning stream events in `kd chat`
- [ ] Setting is controlled via config (under chat/council config), and defaults to enabled
- [ ] Thinking content is visually distinct from normal assistant output and from user prompt text
- [ ] Normal assistant output streaming still works and remains source of truth for finalized messages
- [ ] Add tests covering enabled and disabled behavior for thinking rendering
- [ ] Document the config key and visual behavior in ticket worklog and/or chat docs

## Worklog

- 2026-02-16: Ticket created from live debug stream analysis (`council-72f2`) showing Cursor emits `thinking` events that are currently not rendered in TUI.
