# Thread history display on open

## Context

When opening an existing thread, load all finalized messages and render them as MessagePanels in sequence order. Also pick up any in-flight stream files from external queries.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] On thread open, `list_messages()` loads all existing messages in sequence order
- [ ] Each message rendered as a `MessagePanel` in the message log
- [ ] King messages and member messages display with correct styling
- [ ] In-flight `.stream-{member}.jsonl` files detected and shown as read-only `StreamingPanel`s
- [ ] Empty thread (just created with `--new`) shows no messages, just the input area
- [ ] Thread with many messages loads and scrolls to the bottom on initial render
