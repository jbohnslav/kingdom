# Streaming display: connect polling to widget lifecycle

## Context

Connect the file polling logic to the widget lifecycle: WaitingPanel → StreamingPanel → MessagePanel transitions as responses arrive. This is the core streaming UX.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] On poll update "stream started": WaitingPanel upgrades to StreamingPanel
- [ ] On poll update "stream delta": StreamingPanel content updated with new text, char count in title updates
- [ ] On poll update "message finalized": StreamingPanel replaced with MessagePanel (full Markdown render)
- [ ] On poll update "new message" (from external process): MessagePanel added to log
- [ ] WaitingPanels created for all expected members on broadcast send
- [ ] Error responses (messages with `*Error:` prefix) render as ErrorPanel with hint text
- [ ] In-flight external stream files shown as read-only StreamingPanels (no duplicate queries launched)
- [ ] Manual test: send a message in TUI, see waiting → streaming → finalized lifecycle for each member
