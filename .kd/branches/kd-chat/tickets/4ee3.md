# kd chat: label interrupted partial messages so they aren't mistaken as complete

When a `kd chat` response is interrupted mid-stream, the resulting visible message should be clearly labeled as interrupted/incomplete so it is not mistaken for a full final answer later.

Repro:
1. Start a chat response that is actively streaming.
2. Interrupt it before completion.
3. Re-open/read thread history later.

Current pain:
- Partial text can look like a normal completed response.

Expected:
- Interrupted responses display an explicit marker at the bottom (for example: "[Interrupted]") in both live TUI view and when revisiting the thread.
- Label should be visually distinct from normal completion and timeout/error states.

Acceptance criteria:
- Interrupting an in-flight response produces a persisted interrupted/incomplete indicator.
- TUI message rendering shows the interrupted marker on replay/history, not only live stream.
- Normal completed responses remain unlabeled.
- Add automated tests for interrupted vs complete rendering.

Notes:
- Related to interrupt handling ticket `d869` and message metadata ticket `9124`.
