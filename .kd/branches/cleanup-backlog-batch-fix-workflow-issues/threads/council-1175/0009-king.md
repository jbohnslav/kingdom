Re-read the design doc at .kd/branches/cleanup-backlog-batch-fix-workflow-issues/design.md, then review the implementation changes in src/kingdom/cli.py, src/kingdom/ticket.py, tests/test_cli_council.py, tests/test_done.py, and tests/test_ticket.py. Check: (1) Does the implementation match the design? (2) Any bugs or edge cases missed? (3) Any concerns with the migration command or backwards compat? (4) Anything we should fix before merging?
