Review the latest round of changes since the last review. Focus on the migrate command fixes (--apply flag, collision preflight, git mv), the --include-done flag on tk list, the migrate tests in test_cli_ticket.py, and the actual migration commit (128 files renamed). Check for anything we missed or got wrong. Files to review: src/kingdom/cli.py (migrate command ~line 1971, ticket_list ~line 2139), tests/test_cli_ticket.py (TestMigrate class), src/kingdom/ticket.py (generate_ticket_id). Run: git log --oneline -3 to see the recent commits.
