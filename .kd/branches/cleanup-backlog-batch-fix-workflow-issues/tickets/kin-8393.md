# Redesign tk move for multi-ID support

`tk pull` already supports multiple IDs (verified, tests pass). `tk move` still only accepts a single ID due to positional `[target]` arg conflict.

Redesign: `kd tk move <ids>... --to <target>` for multi-ID moves. Single-ID `kd tk move <id> [target]` keeps current behavior for backwards compat.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `kd tk move <id1> <id2> --to <branch>` moves multiple tickets
- [ ] `kd tk move <id> <target>` still works (backwards compat)
- [ ] 2-pass validation (all tickets exist before moving any)
