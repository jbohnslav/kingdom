# Simplify ticket IDs - drop kin- prefix or use integers

Ticket IDs are always kin-XXXX (4 hex chars). The kin- prefix is redundant since every ticket has it. Options: (1) drop the prefix entirely and just use the 4-char hex, (2) use auto-incrementing integers (1, 2, 3...), (3) keep hex but no prefix. find_ticket already strips the kin- prefix for matching, so the prefix adds no value.
