# Fix pre-existing test failure: test_cursor_assistant_snapshot_chunks_should_use_latest_snapshot

Found on `polish` branch during 8dea research. The test `TestThreadPollerStreaming::test_cursor_assistant_snapshot_chunks_should_use_latest_snapshot` fails with `assert 0 == 1` (no StreamDelta events emitted). Likely caused by changes to cursor snapshot handling on this branch.

Location: `tests/test_tui_poll.py:233`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test passes
- [ ] Cursor snapshot merge logic is correct for cross-batch cumulative snapshots
