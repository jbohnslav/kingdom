# Worklog extraction reads to EOF instead of stopping at next heading

Found by Codex's PR #26 review.

`append_worklog_entry()` (ticket.py:359) now treats Worklog as a bounded section (stops at next heading), but `extract_worklog()` (harness.py:139) still reads from `## Worklog` to EOF. Tickets with sections after Worklog will leak non-worklog content into harness/review prompts.

Either make both section-bounded or define Worklog as always terminal.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `extract_worklog` stops at the next heading (consistent with `append_worklog_entry`)
- [ ] Test covers ticket with content after `## Worklog` section
