# Fix double find_ticket lookup in --duplicate-of close path

Council review flagged this as blocking.

`ticket_close` with `--duplicate-of` calls `find_ticket` up to three times: once to set the `duplicate_of` field (line ~3630), once to append the worklog (line ~3645), and once inside `update_ticket_status`. Restructure to do a single lookup and pass the ticket object through.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `ticket_close --duplicate-of` performs only one `find_ticket` call
- [ ] Existing tests still pass
