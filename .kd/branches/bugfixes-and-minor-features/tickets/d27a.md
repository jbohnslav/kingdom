# tk list summary counts ignore active --status/--priority filters

Found by Codex's PR #26 review.

`cli.py:3307`: The summary line ("5 open, 22 closed, 27 total") is computed from the unfiltered ticket list, even when `--status` or `--priority` filters are active. The displayed rows and summary disagree, which is misleading in filtered views.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Summary counts reflect the active filters (or are omitted/labeled when filtered)
- [ ] Test covers filtered summary output
