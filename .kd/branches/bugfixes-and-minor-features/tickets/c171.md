# setup-skill breaks when run outside repo root

Council review flagged this as medium severity.

`cli.py:180` builds the skill source path from `Path.cwd() / "skills" / "kingdom"`. Running `kd setup-skill` from a subdirectory inside the repo fails with "Skill directory not found." Should resolve the repo root first (e.g. via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`) or resolve from the package path.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `kd setup-skill` works when run from any subdirectory within the repo
- [ ] Test covers running from a subdirectory
