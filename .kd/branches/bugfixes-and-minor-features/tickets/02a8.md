# Pythonic deslop

Reduce Python 'slop' across the branch before feature/bug work. Focus on simplifying implementations, naming, and explicit data flow where current code is over-complicated.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- Identify and implement targeted cleanups that materially improve readability and maintainability without changing behavior.\n- Preserve functionality and keep tests green.\n- Keep changes minimal and practical (no speculative abstraction).\n- Add brief ticket worklog notes on what was simplified and why.
