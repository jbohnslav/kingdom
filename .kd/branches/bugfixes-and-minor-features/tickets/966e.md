# Chat TUI: sending a message while response is in-flight crashes with error

Sending a new message in `kd chat` while an agent response is still streaming/pending causes a crash. The TUI should either queue the message or disable input until the current response completes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sending a message while a response is in-flight does not crash
- [ ] User input is either queued or gracefully blocked until the current response finishes
- [ ] No data loss — the user's message should not be silently dropped
