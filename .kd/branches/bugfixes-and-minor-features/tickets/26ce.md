# Chat TUI crash: AttributeError style object has no attribute _color in long sessions

## Notes

- Possibly related to long-lived or reattached terminal sessions (e.g. SSH disconnect/reconnect)
- `_color` is a specific attribute — grep TUI code for style/color access patterns to find the crash site
- May overlap with 5a32 (MountError on stale widget) — check for shared root cause

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ]
