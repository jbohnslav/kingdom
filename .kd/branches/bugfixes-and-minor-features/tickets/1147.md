# Peasant --hand mode exits immediately without doing work

`kd peasant start 98f3 --hand` appeared to complete instantly (1 iteration, 148 bytes of log output). The harness called claude with `--print` which just prints and exits — no interactive agent loop. The peasant reported "working" status but made no code changes. Possibly the `--hand` flag causes a different code path that doesn't actually run the agent loop properly.

**Observed:** Peasant logs show one iteration, calls backend with `--dangerously-skip-permissions --print`, exits immediately.

**Expected:** Peasant should run a full agent loop — read the ticket, investigate the code, make changes, run tests.

**Possibly related:** May only affect `--hand` mode (serial, current dir). Worktree mode untested.
