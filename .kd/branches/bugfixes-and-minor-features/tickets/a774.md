# remove_member_panels skips thinking panels — missing from prefix tuple

Found by Claude's PR review on #26.

`tui/app.py:725-729`: `remove_member_panels` docstring says it removes thinking panels, but `"thinking"` is missing from the prefix tuple. Compare with `action_interrupt` (line 458) which correctly includes it. During auto-turn follow-ups, if a member has an active ThinkingPanel from the broadcast phase, it will be left orphaned and a duplicate `thinking-{name}` panel will be inserted.

Fix: add `"thinking"` to the prefix tuple so it reads `("wait", "stream", "thinking", "interrupted")`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `remove_member_panels` removes thinking panels
- [ ] Test covers the thinking panel removal scenario
