Hi King. On `polish`, all listed tickets are closed, so this branch looks feature-complete from the ticket board.

If you want, I can help drive the next discussion on one of these:
1. Release readiness checks (`kd done`, manual CLI spot checks, risk scan)
2. UX follow-ups we should backlog from the polish pass
3. Whether to merge `polish` now or run one more council review round
