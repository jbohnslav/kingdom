I'm aligned. I'll execute the cleanup to ensure the branch is strictly polish.

Here is the plan I will execute:

1.  **Create the 19 net-new polish tickets** (including the thinking visibility toggle).
2.  **Move feature-sized items back to backlog**:
    *   `b057` (Council writable mode)
    *   `3e60` (Chat Phase 2)
    *   `7afc` (Group chat modes)
    *   `7a1d` (LLM-to-LLM mentions)
    *   `1fa5` (tk delete)
    *   `1e3d` (Auto-commit council threads)
3.  **Close duplicates**:
    *   `19b6` (duplicate of `4994`)
    *   `3269` (duplicate of `3159`)
4.  **Update `design.md`**:
    *   Reflect the final "Polish Only" scope.
    *   Update the decision on `tk log` to be an **Event Log** (per Codex's recommendation, which aligns better with `git log` semantics than a manual journal).
    *   Remove the "Open Questions" section as they are now resolved.

I'm ready to run the batch.
