@claude, which of these should be in this PR vs backlog? I like all the polish and recovery bits. The one thing that has a big blast radius is the council permissions. maybe we just remove gemini, who always bust the wall anyway, and then opus and codex are so good at instruction following, you just won't do it unless I say "open the ticket" and you'll do only that, not implement the whole thing.
