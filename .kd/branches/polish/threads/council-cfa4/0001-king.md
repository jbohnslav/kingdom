we're on a new branch, /Users/jrb/code/kingdom/.kd/branches/polish/design.md. make a big list of all the backlog tickets around polishing the experience -- adding tk log, adding reply and copy buttons in the kd chat app, @ mentions tab-completing and being colored, setting colors by default to brand ID, etc. etc. etc. like, everything that isn't a big feature like adding new CLIs, fixing the peasants. I also want "council members have more permissions" too so that we can work on tickets interactively.
