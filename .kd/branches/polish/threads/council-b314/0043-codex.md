Aligned. I’d ship this exact top section:

```md
Kingdom (`kd`) is a markdown file-based CLI for software development: design with a multi-agent council, track work as markdown tickets, and run background RALPH loops with worker peasants.

The kingdom metaphor is intentional: you are the King, a council of frontier coding agent CLIs you already use (Claude Code and Codex) debates tradeoffs with your existing logins, and peasants execute tickets in parallel worktrees. Gastown minus the polecats.
```

This keeps it concrete, non-defensive, and non-redundant. I can patch `README.md` now.
