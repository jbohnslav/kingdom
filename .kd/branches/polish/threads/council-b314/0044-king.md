Okay, I patched the README myself. I think the rest of it is somewhat redundant. It should be like: kd start (initialize kd repo), configure your agent CLIs in the config.json, use the `kd chat` TUI to talk to the council and iterate on your design doc, then `kd breakdown` to break it into tickets. Review the tickets. Then, execute in series if you want (just tell Claude Code or Codex to work on the tickets) or tell peasants to do the work in parallel worktrees.
