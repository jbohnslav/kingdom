**One sentence**
Kingdom (`kd`) is a git-native CLI that helps you plan and ship software by running multi-model AI design councils, turning outcomes into tickets, and executing work through agent workers.

**Long version**
Kingdom is an opinionated development workflow layer on top of your existing repo. You define a goal, run a council to get multiple model perspectives on design/tradeoffs, break the result into explicit tickets, and then execute those tickets with worker agents in parallel. The system keeps state in `.kd/` as plain files (tickets, discussions, decisions, archives), so process and decision history stay versioned with your code. It is built for “design first, then implement” teams that want better planning quality and faster execution without replacing git, PRs, or normal engineering practices.
