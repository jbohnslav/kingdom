okay, great. check the readme. I want to work on the description. Codex is closer, but it's not opinionated. It lets you make tickets as markdown files, design with a multi-agent council, and run RALPH loops in the background with worker peasants. "Gastown minus the polecats." and I want a sentence toward the top on the kingdom metaphor.
