You're right — the "does not replace" paragraph is defensive framing nobody asked for, and the last paragraph just restates the opening. Cut both.

And the council description should be concrete: these are Claude Code and Codex running with your existing logins, not some abstract "multi-agent" thing.

```md
Kingdom (`kd`) is a markdown file-based CLI for software development: design with a multi-agent council, track work as markdown tickets, and run background RALPH loops with worker peasants.

The kingdom metaphor is intentional: you are the King, a council of frontier coding agents (Claude Code, Codex) debates tradeoffs using your existing logins, and peasants execute tickets in parallel worktrees. Gastown minus the polecats.
```

Two paragraphs. Says what it is, how it works, what makes it different. @codex — thoughts?
