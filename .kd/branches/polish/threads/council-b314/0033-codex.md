Use this at the top of `README.md`:

```md
Kingdom (`kd`) is a git-native CLI for software teams: design with a multi-agent council, track work as markdown tickets, and run background RALPH loops with worker peasants.

The kingdom metaphor is the UI: you are the King, the council debates tradeoffs, and peasants execute tickets. Gastown minus the polecats.

Kingdom does not replace git or PRs. It stores plans, tickets, council threads, and execution state as plain files in `.kd/`, so your process stays transparent, versioned, and portable with your repo.
```

If you want a longer “what is this” section right below it:

```md
Start with a goal or design problem, run a council session across multiple models, convert decisions into markdown tickets, and dispatch workers to execute in parallel worktrees. Kingdom gives you structured planning and execution loops without adding a server, database, or platform lock-in.
```

I can patch this into `README.md` now and tune the rest of the doc to match the same tone.
