One thing I think we need, above the "how to use" is a bullet-pointed list. Multi-agent chat lets you get the best of all the frontier coding models, not just one opinion. breaking it down into tickets helps with context rot, or lets you use cheaper models for the short, already scoped and designed tickets, or just gets work done in parallel. Multi-agent reviews always catch bugs that single agent reviews don't. It's all just markdown files, so your coding agents are already good at finding them, updating them, reading them, etc. The TUI is for human use, but agent CLIs can use the CLI itself to ask the council or other agents for their opinions.
