Let me update the ticket with those items and add the LICENSE file now since that's straightforward.Let me update the ticket to add the King's requested items.Updated the ticket with two new acceptance criteria:

- **Rewrite README.md** — polished, readable, publish-ready (PyPI install command, clear examples, good structure)
- **Add comprehensive architecture doc** (`docs/architecture.md`) — system design, module layout, data flow, extension points

The full ticket `02b5` now covers: LICENSE (Apache-2.0), pyproject metadata, README rewrite, architecture doc, dependency audit, packaging validation, smoke test, and release runbook. That's everything you need before the first real PyPI publish.

Want me to pull this ticket and start working through it? The LICENSE file and pyproject metadata are quick wins we could knock out right away.
