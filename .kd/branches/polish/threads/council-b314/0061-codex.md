Keeping only `worklog audit trail` in the `Why` section is the right call.

Suggested final wording for that bullet, if you want it tighter:

- **Worklog audit trail** — peasants append decisions, failed attempts, and test results to ticket markdown, so you can review *why* a change happened, not just the diff.

If you want, I’ll do one final README polish pass for consistency, then move straight into the blocking publish prereqs (`LICENSE`, `pyproject` metadata, and release-ready docs).
