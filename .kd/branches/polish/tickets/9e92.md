# kd council show --last N for long threads

Huge markdown dumps are hard to read. Support pagination or --last N to show only recent messages.

## Worklog

- Feature was already implemented: `--last N` shows last N turns, `--all` shows full history, default shows latest turn only
- Fixed 54 pre-existing test failures caused by cursor backend removal (ticket c937):
  - Removed cursor-specific test classes from test_council.py, test_tui_poll.py
  - Updated test assertions expecting 3 council members to expect 2 (claude, codex)
  - Extracted dead legacy code in council_show into show_legacy_run helper function
  - Added missing coerce_to_str_list import in test_ticket.py
- All 1039 tests pass, ruff clean
