# kd done: structured summary panel

Replace multiple typer.echo() calls with a Rich-formatted summary panel.

## Worklog

- Replaced `kd done` summary output with a Rich Panel:
  - Panel title shows "Done: <branch>" in bold green
  - Panel body shows tickets closed count (cyan), session cleared status, and push reminder (yellow)
  - Green border for visual success indicator
- Fixed Rich markup escaping for `[status]` in open ticket error listing (bracket was being interpreted as style tag)
- Updated existing test assertions for the new panel format
- Added `test_done_renders_rich_panel` test verifying box-drawing characters and content
