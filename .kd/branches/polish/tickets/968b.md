# Standardize error output styling across CLI

Replace typer.echo('Error: ...') with consistent Rich-styled errors across all commands.

## Worklog

- 2026-02-17 03:23 — Standardized all error output: added print_error() helper with Rich-styled stderr, replaced 22 typer.echo Error calls, updated follow-up lines to use error_console, fixed test assertions for new output formats.
- [03:24] Closed: All typer.echo Error patterns replaced with consistent Rich-styled print_error(), tests passing.
