# kd tk dep overwrites existing dependencies instead of appending

`kd tk dep` should add a dependency while preserving existing deps. Current behavior appears to replace the deps list with only the latest dep.

Repro:
1. Run `kd tk dep cf1a 3642`
2. Run `kd tk dep cf1a d869`
3. Inspect ticket frontmatter

Observed:
- `deps: [d869]`

Expected:
- `deps: [3642, d869]` (append when absent, no-op if already present)
