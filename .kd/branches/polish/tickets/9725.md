# kd chat: use brand-aware default member colors (Claude orange, explicit Cursor/OpenAI choices)

Use deterministic, brand-aware default colors for council/chat members instead of generic hash-based colors.

Context:
- `claude` should default to a Claude-orange color.
- `cursor` and `openai/codex` are harder because their logos are mostly black/white, so we need a clear, readable fallback palette policy for terminal themes.

Scope:
- Define a stable default color mapping for known members (at minimum: `claude`, `codex`/`openai`, `cursor`).
- Keep unknown member names on a deterministic fallback strategy.
- Ensure colors remain readable in common terminal themes.
- Document rationale so future member additions are consistent.

Acceptance criteria:
- Claude messages render with a Claude-orange default.
- Cursor and OpenAI/Codex have explicit default colors chosen and documented (not left to random hash ordering).
- Color mapping is deterministic across sessions/machines.
- Existing color-related behavior/tests are updated to reflect explicit defaults.

Notes:
- Coordinate with ongoing color determinism work to avoid overlap (`3d28`).
