# kd chat: auto-scroll polish

Don't snap to bottom if the user is actively reading history when a new token arrives.

## Worklog

- 2026-02-17 03:21 — Added smart auto-scroll to MessageLog: is_following property wraps Textual's anchor mechanism, status bar uses public API instead of private _anchor_released. Added SCROLL_THRESHOLD class variable. Fixed unrelated syntax error in widgets.py. Added 4 tests for scroll behavior.
