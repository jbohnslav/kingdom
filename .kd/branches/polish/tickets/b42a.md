# Council status symbols need a legend

State symbols in council output are cryptic without explanation. Add a legend or use descriptive labels.

## Work Log

- Changed `state_symbols` dict in `council_list` to store `(symbol, label)` tuples instead of bare symbols
- Added a legend line printed after all threads: `responded  running  errored  timed out  pending` (dimmed, with symbols)
- Legend only appears when threads exist (no legend on "No council threads" output)
- Added 2 tests: `test_list_shows_legend` and `test_list_no_legend_when_no_threads`
- Fixed pre-existing test assertion counts in `test_ask_thread_new_starts_fresh` and `test_at_all_queries_everyone` (expected 4 messages but only 2 council members)
