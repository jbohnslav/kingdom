# Standardize 'no results' messages with next-step guidance

e.g. 'No tickets found. Create one with kd tk create' — helpful empty states everywhere.

## Worklog

- 2026-02-17 03:24 — Standardized no-results messages across all CLI commands with next-step guidance:
- ticket list (branch, backlog, --all): suggest kd tk create
- ticket ready: suggest kd tk create or kd tk list
- ticket show --all: suggest kd tk create
- council list: suggest kd council ask
- council status --all: suggest kd council ask
- council show (no messages, no history): suggest kd council ask
- council retry (no king message): suggest kd council ask
- peasant status: suggest kd peasant start
- peasant read (no messages): note peasant may still be working
- peasant logs (empty): note peasant may still be starting up
- peasant review (no work thread): suggest kd peasant start
Added tests in test_cli_ticket.py, test_cli_council.py, test_cli_peasant.py
