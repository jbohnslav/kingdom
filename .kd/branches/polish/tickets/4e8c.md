# kd chat: error panel should show context and retry hint

Currently just shows 'errored' or 'timed out' with no guidance. Add context about what failed and suggest retry.

## Work Log

- Added `format_error_body()` helper that extracts meaningful error detail and adds retry hints
- Updated `ErrorPanel.on_mount()` to detect error type (timeout, error, interrupted, empty response)
- Interrupted errors now get yellow border and "interrupted" label (vs red "errored")
- Timeout errors show the timeout detail and suggest `@member` to retry
- Generic errors suggest `kd council status` for config debugging
- Empty responses get a specific "rephrase your question" hint
- Added 7 tests for `format_error_body` covering all error types
