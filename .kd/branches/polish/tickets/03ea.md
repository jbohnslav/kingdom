# kd chat: thinking visibility toggle hotkey

Add a hotkey (e.g. t) to toggle thinking visibility globally, overriding auto-collapse behavior.

## Worklog

- Added `ctrl+t` keybinding to ChatApp that cycles thinking visibility: auto -> show -> hide -> auto
- `action_toggle_thinking()` updates `self.thinking_visibility` and applies to all existing ThinkingPanel widgets
- `apply_thinking_visibility()` hides/shows/expands panels based on new mode, respecting user_pinned state
- Updated status bar hints and help text (`/help`) to include Ctrl+T
- Added `THINKING_CYCLE` class variable for the cycle order
- Added 10 tests in `TestToggleThinking` covering cycling, system messages, panel visibility, user_pinned respect, and binding registration
