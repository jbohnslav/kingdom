# kd tk move: human-readable location in success message

Currently uses opaque parent.parent.name. Clarify with human-readable location names like 'backlog' or branch name.

## Worklog

- 2026-02-17 03:30 — Replaced opaque path references (dest_dir.parent.name, new_path.parent.parent.name) with explicit dest_label variable. Backlog shows 'backlog', branches show "branch '<name>'". Added test for move-to-backlog label.
