Review the design doc Design already exists at .kd/branches/config-system/design.md, the tickets on this branch e01c [P1][closed] - Fix timeout=None TypeError in council targeted queries
3860 [P2][closed] - Add JSON config file for system-wide agent and workflow settings
d52d [P2][closed] - Create config.py with dataclasses and load/validate
a9f1 [P2][closed] - Update kd init, .gitignore, and state.py for config
fe0b [P2][closed] - Wire config into peasant/harness and design/synthesis
3f8e [P2][closed] - Update kd doctor to validate config
5151 [P2][closed] - Refactor agent.py: remove agent file code, add BACKEND_DEFAULTS
b65d [P2][closed] - Wire config into council creation and prompt merging
fc3f [P2][closed] - Add kd config show command, and the current state of the code. To what extent does our solution match the king's intent in the design doc? To what extent does the implementation match the plan? Are there tickets to close or reopen? Do the features work? Use the actual  cli yourself as intended as a one-off integration test if necessary. If you find bugs on this branch, reopen the ticket and add it to the worklog. If you find bugs unrelated to this branch, open a ticket in the backlog.

Review the code quality. Does it work? Is it efficient? Are there edge cases we haven't caught? Does it follow Python best practices? Can you find ways to simplify?
