Second review pass on the updated design doc at .kd/branches/config-system/design.md. Read it fresh. Key changes since last review: .kd/config.json (not project root), model is first-class, per-agent-per-phase prompt overrides, unknown keys are hard errors. Is this ready to implement? Any remaining gaps or issues?
