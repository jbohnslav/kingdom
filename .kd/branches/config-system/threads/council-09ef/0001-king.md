kd tk show 3860. we're going to add a config management system, or like at least one configuration file that is, to Kingdom. I want it to be uh JSON, because everyone's familiar with editing JSON config files from ES code and similar. So I want the key elements to be configurable. Most importantly, what agents have what roles. So the hand is sort of defined by whatever the user opens up, so don't worry about that. But the council, the number and identity of the council should be configurable. Maybe one person just wants. GPT 5.3 Codex and Claude, and somebody else on five of them, like Claude opus high and Claude Opus low for um You could use the cursor agents to have any different LLM because they are not Lab specific. So you could have, you know, GPT and Claude and Gemini and Kimmy and you know Deepsey all in Five different cursor agents, CLIs. And they should probably be able to have different prompts. Like, one idea is that GPT codecs is extremely good at searching the internet, so you could have a prompt. That's like for that one specifically, search the internet widely for existing docs and repos that do similar stuff and bring that into your answer or something. so, and then another way that kingdom could be used easily and very effectively is that cheaper models could be the peasants because everything has already been designed and screwed. scoped. So if somebody wanted to, uh they could use a model like Kimmy 2.5 that's ten times cheaper than Claude Code, but only for the peasant. Uh role so those are the things that I can think of right now, but search the internet and read through the comparisons of our work to third parties that we have here in the docs directory. um and see what do other people put in their config system, what are users going to want other than what I've described, and then add it to the design doc that you can find with KD start. or just respond here and we'll co-op collab on the design dog together.
