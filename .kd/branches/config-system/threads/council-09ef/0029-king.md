Read the design doc (kd design show), the tickets (kd tk list, kd tk show for each), and the current state of the code on this branch. To what extent does our solution match the king's intent in the design doc? To what extent does the implementation match the plan? Are there tickets to close or reopen? Do the features work? Review the code quality — does it work, is it efficient, are there edge cases we haven't caught, does it follow Python best practices, can you find ways to simplify? Use the actual kd CLI yourself as an integration test if necessary. If you find bugs on this branch, reopen the ticket and add it to the worklog. If you find bugs unrelated to this branch, open a ticket in the backlog.
