I’ll review this as a council advisor only: inspect `kd design`, enumerate branch tickets with `kd tk list`, read the relevant implementation, and run `kd` as a one-off integration check. I’ll then map findings to intent vs plan, and recommend which tickets to close/reopen plus any backlog issues.
I’m using the `kingdom` skill for this turn because your request is a branch-level `kd` workflow audit (design, tickets, implementation, and integration behavior). Next I’ll gather `kd status`, `kd design show`, and ticket details, then inspect code paths tied to those tickets.
I found unexpected untracked files in the branch (`.kd/branches/backlog-clear/threads/council-1ecf/0007-king.md`, `0008-cursor.md`, `0009-king.md`) that I did not create. Per your workflow rules, I need your direction before proceeding: should I ignore these and continue the audit, or treat them as part of this review scope?
