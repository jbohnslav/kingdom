# kd tk commands should echo ticket ID and title in output

## Problem

`kd tk create --backlog "title"` outputs just a raw file path (`.kd/backlog/tickets/6412.md`). No title, no ticket ID highlighted. Similarly, `kd tk close 3f8e` outputs `3f8e: in_progress → closed` — the state transition is clear but you have to remember what 3f8e was.

All ticket mutation commands should echo the ticket title so you don't have to hold IDs in your head.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `kd tk create` echoes ticket ID and title (e.g., `Created 6412: "Council async UX is broken..."`)
- [ ] `kd tk close/start/reopen` includes ticket title in output (e.g., `3f8e: in_progress → closed — Update kd doctor to validate config`)
- [ ] `kd tk move` includes ticket title in output
