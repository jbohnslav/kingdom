# kd council show should default to most recent thread, not longest

## Context

`kd council show` without an ID currently shows the thread with the most
messages, not the most recently created one. When you just fired off a new
question and want to check on it, you see the old thread instead.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `kd council show` (no args) defaults to the most recently created thread
- [x] If there's an active watch/async thread, prefer that one

## Worklog

- `council_show` now falls back to most recent council thread (by `created_at`)
  when `current_thread` pointer is None. The `current_thread` pointer (set by
  `council ask`) still takes precedence when present — this covers the
  active/async case.
- Changed error message from "No current council thread" to "No council threads"
- Added test `test_show_defaults_to_most_recent_thread` with deterministic
  timestamps
- Renamed old `test_show_no_thread_errors` to `test_show_no_threads_at_all_errors`
