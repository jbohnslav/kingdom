# kd done should show a summary

## Problem

`kd done` outputs `Done: 'config-system'` and nothing else. No indication of what it actually did (checked tickets, cleared session pointer, cleaned worktrees). You have to trust it worked.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `kd done` shows ticket count (e.g., "9 tickets closed")
- [ ] `kd done` confirms session cleared
- [ ] `kd done` reminds to push if there are unpushed commits
