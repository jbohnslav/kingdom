# kd council status command to show which councillors are still pending

## Context

After `kd council ask`, there's no way to see whether councillors are still
working or have finished/failed. You just wait and hope. Need a way to check
on the status of each councillor's subprocess — are they running, done, or
errored?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New command (e.g. `kd council status`) or addition to `kd council list`
      that shows per-councillor state: pending, running, responded, errored
- [ ] Works for both sync and async council queries
- [ ] Shows which councillors haven't responded yet for a given thread
