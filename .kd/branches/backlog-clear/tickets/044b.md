# kd council status command to show which councillors are still pending

## Context

After `kd council ask`, there's no way to see whether councillors are still
working or have finished/failed. You just wait and hope. Need a way to check
on the status of each councillor's subprocess — are they running, done, or
errored?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] New command (e.g. `kd council status`) or addition to `kd council list`
      that shows per-councillor state: pending, running, responded, errored
- [x] Works for both sync and async council queries
- [x] Shows which councillors haven't responded yet for a given thread

## Worklog

- Added `ThreadStatus` dataclass and `thread_response_status()` to `thread.py`
  — computes who responded after the most recent king ask
- Added `kd council status` command with optional thread_id arg and `--all` flag
- Falls back to current thread or most recent council thread (same logic as
  `council show`)
- 6 tests covering: all responded, partial pending, specific thread, --all,
  no threads error, fallback to most recent
