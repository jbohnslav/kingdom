# kd breakdown: don't auto-populate design doc, improve ticket creation guidance

## Problem

`kd breakdown` currently dumps the entire design doc into its output and gives generic instructions ("create tickets using the `kd` CLI"). Two issues:

1. The design doc is auto-included in the breakdown prompt, which is redundant when the agent already has access to it. It also encourages the agent to parrot the design rather than think about breakdown.
2. The ticket creation guidance is too vague — it doesn't prompt for priorities, logical dependencies between tickets, or meaningful acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `kd breakdown` no longer embeds the design doc contents in its output (the agent can read the file directly)
- [ ] The breakdown prompt explicitly instructs the agent to set priorities on each ticket
- [ ] The breakdown prompt explicitly instructs the agent to identify and set logical dependencies between tickets (`kd tk dep`)
- [ ] The breakdown prompt explicitly instructs the agent to write meaningful acceptance criteria (not just empty checkboxes)
- [ ] The prompt references the design doc path so the agent knows where to find it
