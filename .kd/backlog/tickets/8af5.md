# kd done should error if branch has open tickets

When running `kd done`, if the branch still has open tickets, the command should error out and list the open tickets instead of silently marking the session as done. This prevents losing track of unfinished work. Add a `--force` flag to override when the user intentionally wants to close out with open tickets (e.g. moving them to backlog manually).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `kd done` checks for open tickets on the branch before marking done
- [ ] If open tickets exist, print them and exit with an error
- [ ] `--force` flag bypasses the check
- [ ] Error message suggests next steps (close tickets, move to backlog, or use --force)
