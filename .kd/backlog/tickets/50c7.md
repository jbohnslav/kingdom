# Research Pensieve (Claude Code engineering system) for ideas to bring into kd

## Context

https://github.com/kingkongshot/Pensieve — a Claude Code plugin that encodes engineering
principles into automated workflows. Interesting overlap with what kd does.

Key concepts worth evaluating:
- **Maxims**: universal principles that guide Claude's problem-solving (similar to our CLAUDE.md but more structured)
- **Decisions**: project-specific choices stored persistently (we have council threads, but no formal decision log)
- **Pipelines**: repeatable task patterns (like our skills but more automated)
- **/loop command**: splits, runs, and auto-continues tasks without user oversight (similar to peasant --hand but more autonomous)
- **On-demand context loading**: keeps conversation lean by loading knowledge only when needed
- **Hooks architecture**: SessionStart injects routes, Stop handles auto-continuation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add Pensieve as a git submodule under `vendor/` or `references/`
- [ ] Read through the codebase and document what's novel vs what kd already covers
- [ ] Identify 2-3 concrete ideas we could adopt or adapt (e.g., decision log, pipelines, auto-loop)
- [ ] File follow-up backlog tickets for any ideas worth pursuing
