# Council config schema extension: add council.chat and council.auto_commit to config validation

## Description

Current `VALID_COUNCIL_KEYS` in `config.py` is `{"members", "timeout"}`. The design requires `council.chat` (mode, auto_rounds) and `council.auto_commit`. Add these to the config dataclass, validation, and schema.

Pull into a branch when 1e3d (auto-commit) or 3e60 (chat TUI) / 27ce (Phase 3) need the config keys.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `council.auto_commit` key accepted in config.json (boolean, default true)
- [ ] `council.chat` section accepted with `mode` and `auto_rounds` keys
- [ ] `VALID_COUNCIL_KEYS` updated in `config.py`
- [ ] `ChatConfig` dataclass with validation
- [ ] Existing config tests updated
