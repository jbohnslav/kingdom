# kd chat: improve king message visual styling for better conversation flow

From audit: docs/chat-tui-polish-audit.md (ticket 8dea).

King messages currently have `border: none` and muted text color, making them look like system messages rather than conversation anchors. In a multi-agent chat, the king's messages should be visually prominent.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] King messages have a distinct visual treatment (e.g. right-aligned, background color, or unique border style)
- [ ] King messages are clearly distinguishable from agent responses and system messages
- [ ] Visual treatment is consistent with the overall chat aesthetic
- [ ] Tests updated if widget structure changes
- [ ] Low-medium effort: ~1 hr
