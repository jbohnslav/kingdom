# Council chat room: revive kd chat as interactive multi-agent chat UI

## Description

Revive the old `kd chat` command as an interactive terminal chat room for the council. Instead of `kd council ask` (fire-and-forget), this would be a persistent mini text UI where:

- Messages you type automatically go to all council members (or use @member to address one)
- Responses stream in as they arrive, chat-room style
- Feels like a group chat with the council rather than discrete ask/response cycles

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `kd chat` launches an interactive terminal UI
- [ ] Messages sent to all council members by default
- [ ] Support @-mentioning individual members to direct a message
- [ ] Responses display inline as they arrive
- [ ] Chat history persists in the thread system
