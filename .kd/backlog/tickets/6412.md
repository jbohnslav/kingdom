# Council async UX is broken: no visibility, no retry, silent failures

## Problem

The council async flow has major UX gaps. Real example from the config-system review:

1. **Silent failures with no useful error**: Claude returned `Error: None` twice in a row. Cursor also returned `Error: None` on the same query. No indication of *why* — no stderr, no timeout message, no partial output. The king had to notice "check on claude, any logs? anything?" and manually investigate.

2. **No automatic retry**: After two failures, the only fix was `kd council reset` (nuke all sessions) and manually re-send the query. There's no per-member retry, no "retry failed members" command, no automatic backoff.

3. **No visibility while running**: Background council queries give no progress indication. The king sees "Running in background" and then... nothing until it either works or silently fails. No streaming, no heartbeat, no "claude is thinking..." status.

4. **Reset is a sledgehammer**: `kd council reset` clears ALL sessions. If codex was working fine and claude was broken, you still nuke codex's session to fix claude. Need per-member session management.

5. **`--async` + `watch` flow is fragile**: The watch command depends on the thread completing within timeout, but if a member silently hangs, watch just waits until timeout with no feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Failed council members show a meaningful error (not `Error: None`)
- [ ] `kd council ask` retries failed members automatically (at least once)
- [ ] Per-member session reset (`kd council reset --member claude`)
- [ ] Progress/status visibility while council queries are running
- [ ] `kd council retry <thread-id>` to re-query only failed members in a thread
