# council status should show richer member states (interrupted, stopped, timed out) not just pending/responded

## Context

`kd council status` currently shows only "pending" or "responded" per member.
When an agent process was killed (exit code -2), timed out, or errored, it
still shows "pending" — which implies it's still running. The log files have
the real story (error messages, exit codes) but you have to dig into them
manually.

Possible states to distinguish:
- **responded** — wrote a message to the thread
- **running** — worker process is still alive (check PID/lock file)
- **interrupted** — process exited with signal (exit code < 0)
- **errored** — process exited with non-zero exit code / logged an error
- **timed out** — exceeded configured timeout
- **pending** — no process evidence found yet (maybe hasn't started)

This likely requires parsing the tail of the log file for exit codes and
error markers, and/or checking if the async worker process is still alive.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `kd council status` distinguishes at least: responded, running, errored/interrupted, pending
- [ ] Status is derived from log files and/or worker process state
- [ ] Tests cover each distinguishable state
