# Publish prereqs: LICENSE, pyproject metadata, README, classifiers, URLs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add top-level `LICENSE` file with Apache License 2.0 text.
- [x] Update `README.md` license section to Apache-2.0 (remove MIT reference).
- [x] Replace placeholder package description in `pyproject.toml` with a real one-sentence summary.
- [x] Add/confirm PEP 621 metadata in `pyproject.toml`:
  - [x] `license` (SPDX expression `Apache-2.0`)
  - [x] `authors` (at least one entry)
  - [x] `keywords` (search/discoverability)
  - [x] `classifiers` (license, Python versions, intended audience/topic, CLI env)
  - [x] `urls` (Homepage, Repository, Issues, Changelog)
- [x] Audit runtime dependencies in `pyproject.toml` and move non-runtime deps out of `[project].dependencies`.
- [x] Make README publish-ready for PyPI:
  - [x] install command uses published package name (`pip install kingdom-cli`)
  - [x] minimal "first command" usage example
  - [x] link to docs and issue tracker
- [x] Add `.github/release.yml` categories so GitHub auto release notes are grouped by labels.
- [ ] Set GitHub repository metadata:
  - [ ] repository description
  - [x] repository topics/tags
- [x] Packaging validation passes:
  - [x] `uv build`
  - [x] `uv run python -m twine check dist/*`
- [x] Install smoke test from built wheel in a clean env succeeds and `kd --help` works.
- [x] Rewrite README.md to be polished, readable, and publish-ready (install from PyPI, clear examples, good structure).
- [x] Add comprehensive architecture doc (`docs/architecture.md`) covering system design, module layout, data flow, and extension points.
- [x] First publish dry-run checklist documented in `docs/` (version bump -> merge to `master` -> verify Release + PyPI).
