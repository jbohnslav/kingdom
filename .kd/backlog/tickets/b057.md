# kd council: allow opt-in writable mode so members can edit files when requested

Council members currently behave as read-only advisors and refuse to edit files even when explicitly asked. This makes `kd council` less useful for execution-oriented tasks.

Repro:
1. Run `kd council ask "Please edit file X to do Y"`
2. Members respond with analysis/advice only and do not make changes

Expected:
- Provide an opt-in mode where council members are allowed to perform edits (or hand off into executable workflows) when explicitly requested.
- Keep current advisory-only behavior as a safe default unless user enables writable mode.

Possible directions:
- Add a council mode/flag (e.g. advisory vs execute) in config and/or CLI.
- Make council preamble configurable per mode so edit permissions are explicit.
- Surface current mode in output so users know whether edits are allowed.

Acceptance criteria:
- Users can intentionally enable a writable/execution-capable council mode.
- Default behavior remains safe/advisory unless enabled.
- Docs explain tradeoffs and how to switch modes.
- Add tests for mode selection and prompt/preamble behavior.

Notes:
- Coordinate with existing preamble/config work (e.g. ticket 8461) to avoid duplicate implementation.
