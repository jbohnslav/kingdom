# Add kd council review as shortcut for code review asks

Add a kd council review command that's essentially kd council ask --new-thread with a built-in prompt tailored for code reviews. Should diff the current branch against base, include the diff in the prompt, and ask the council to review the changes. Saves the user from having to compose the review prompt manually every time.
