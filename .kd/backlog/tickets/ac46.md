# kd chat: render streaming content as Markdown instead of plain text

From audit: docs/chat-tui-polish-audit.md (ticket 8dea).

Currently `StreamingPanel.update_content()` renders raw text + cursor character. While streaming, content looks like raw markup (e.g. `**bold**` shown literally). Only finalized messages get Markdown rendering. This creates a jarring visual jump when a response finalizes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] StreamingPanel renders content as Markdown (not plain text) during streaming
- [ ] Cursor indicator (block cursor) still visible at end of streamed content
- [ ] No significant performance regression (Markdown re-render on every delta is expensive; may need throttling)
- [ ] Smooth transition from streaming to finalized panel (no visual jump)
- [ ] Tests updated for new rendering behavior
- [ ] Medium effort: ~1 hr (may need Textual Markdown.get_stream() or throttled re-render)
