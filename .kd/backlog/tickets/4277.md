# Replace emoji warning with text in no-diff path for dumb terminals

Council review flagged this as low severity.

`cli.py:2479` uses a Unicode emoji `⚠` directly in `typer.echo` for the no-diff warning. On dumb terminals (`TERM=dumb`), the emoji may render as a question mark or garble. Should use text like `WARNING:` instead, or route through `styled_echo`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No-diff warning uses plain text instead of emoji
- [ ] Warning renders cleanly on dumb terminals
