# Phase 3: group chat auto-mode orchestration (round-robin, interrupts, stop conditions)

## Description

After dogfooding `kd chat` (Phase 2), build the group chat orchestration layer. Councillors enter auto-mode after the initial broadcast round — sequential round-robin, bounded by a hard cap on rounds.

Deferred from council-improvements PR intentionally. Design doc captures full requirements under Phase 3. Ticket this when Phase 2 is stable and dogfooded.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] After initial broadcast round (parallel), councillors enter auto-mode (sequential round-robin)
- [ ] Thread history injection: each auto-turn builds full thread context into the prompt (don't rely on session resume)
- [ ] Config-driven: `council.chat.auto_rounds` (default 3), `council.chat.mode` ("broadcast" or "sequential")
- [ ] User typing interrupts auto-mode: stops scheduling new turns, current generation completes, user message sent after
- [ ] Auto-turns are sequential within a round (one member at a time)
- [ ] Stop condition: max rounds reached (hard cap, no heuristics)
