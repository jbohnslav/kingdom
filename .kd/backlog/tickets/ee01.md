# `kd init` should install the Claude agent skill

## Context

The kingdom agent skill (`SKILL.md`) lives in the repo and is symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/kingdom` for development. Users who install from PyPI have no way to get the skill without cloning the repo.

## Plan

1. Bundle `SKILL.md` inside the Python package (`src/kingdom/skills/SKILL.md`)
2. During `kd init`, copy the bundled skill to `~/.claude/skills/kingdom/SKILL.md` using `importlib.resources`
3. Keep the repo symlink for development; PyPI users get it via `kd init`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `SKILL.md` is included in the pip package as package data
- [ ] `kd init` installs the skill to `~/.claude/skills/kingdom/`
- [ ] Works for fresh `pip install kingdom-cli && kd init` without cloning the repo
