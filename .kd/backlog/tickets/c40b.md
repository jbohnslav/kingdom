# kd chat: add /copy slash command to copy last agent response to clipboard

From audit: docs/chat-tui-polish-audit.md (ticket 8dea).

`clipboard.py` exists with `copy_to_clipboard()` but is never wired to any UI action. Users cannot copy agent responses without manual terminal text selection.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/copy` slash command copies the last non-king message body to system clipboard
- [ ] `/copy <member>` copies the last message from a specific member
- [ ] Success/failure feedback shown as system message ("Copied to clipboard" / "No messages to copy")
- [ ] Works on macOS (pbcopy) and Linux (xclip/xsel)
- [ ] Tests for the slash command dispatch and clipboard integration
- [ ] Quick win: estimated ~30 min (clipboard module already exists)
