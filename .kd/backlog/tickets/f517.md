# kd chat: switch MessagePanel from Static+RichMarkdown to native Textual Markdown widget

From audit: docs/chat-tui-polish-audit.md (ticket 8dea).

Currently MessagePanel extends `Static` and renders body via `RichMarkdown`. This misses interactive features that the native Textual `Markdown` widget provides: scrollable code fences, clickable links, proper table rendering, and built-in text selection support.

Both Elia and Toad use the native `Markdown` widget for message display.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MessagePanel uses Textual's `Markdown` widget instead of `Static` + `RichMarkdown`
- [ ] Code blocks in messages are scrollable (not truncated or wrapped)
- [ ] Links in messages are clickable
- [ ] Tables render correctly
- [ ] Member name and colored border preserved
- [ ] King message styling preserved
- [ ] All existing MessagePanel tests pass
- [ ] Medium effort: ~2 hrs (widget change + test updates)
