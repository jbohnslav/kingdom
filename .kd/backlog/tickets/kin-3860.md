# Add JSON config file for system-wide agent and workflow settings

Create a top-level JSON (or TOML) config file that centralizes system configuration. Should cover: which agents are on the council and their model IDs, per-agent permissions/capabilities, custom prompts per workflow phase (ask, design, review) that can vary by model, and any other per-agent or per-phase overrides. Right now this stuff is scattered or hardcoded — having one config file makes it easy to tweak the council composition, swap models, or customize prompts without touching code.
