# peasant status: hide or clean terminal sessions

Dogfooding UX cleanup: completed or terminal peasant sessions stay visible indefinitely in peasant status output, which creates noise during normal operation.

Proposed scope:
- Add a clean option to remove or acknowledge terminal sessions in bulk (done/failed/stopped/blocked as appropriate), or
- Add an active-only status view that hides terminal sessions by default.

Acceptance criteria:
- Terminal sessions can be cleaned/hidden without deleting active work
- peasant status output is less noisy for day-to-day use
- Tests cover the new behavior
