# Council members should not modify files — enforce read-only mode

Council members (claude, codex, cursor) are meant to advise — read code, analyze, and respond with recommendations. They should never write files, delete tickets, or make code changes. Cursor just deleted backlog tickets and wrote code during a council query. Strengthen the council prompts/instructions to make it absolutely clear that council members must not modify anything. They should only read, plan, and respond. If the agent platform supports a read-only or no-write mode, use that too.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Council member prompts explicitly forbid file writes, edits, and deletions
- [ ] Review each agent's allowed_tools / permission config for read-only enforcement
- [ ] Test that a council query doesn't produce any file modifications
