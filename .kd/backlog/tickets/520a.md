# Research Karpathy's LLM Council to inform multi-way council discussion mode

Research Andrej Karpathy's LLM Council concept and use it to inform a multi-way discussion mode for kd council. Currently council members respond independently in parallel and never see each other's answers. A deliberation mode (e.g. --discuss) would collect responses, share them back to all members, and run additional rounds so they can react, converge, or debate. Karpathy's work on LLM Council likely has insights on round structure, convergence, voting, and when multi-round discussion adds value vs. just parallel queries.
