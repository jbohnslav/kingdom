# kd chat: extract inline CSS to external .tcss stylesheet

From audit: docs/chat-tui-polish-audit.md (ticket 8dea).

All TUI styles are currently defined via `DEFAULT_CSS` strings in Python widget classes and `CSS` classvar in ChatApp. Textual best practice is external `.tcss` files for style separation, live-reload during development, and cleaner code.

Both Elia and Toad separate styles from code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All `DEFAULT_CSS` and `CSS` definitions moved to `src/kingdom/tui/chat.tcss`
- [ ] `ChatApp.CSS_PATH` set to reference the external stylesheet
- [ ] Widget classes reference style names/ids consistently
- [ ] `textual run --dev` live-reload works with the extracted stylesheet
- [ ] No visual change from current appearance
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Medium effort: ~1 hr
