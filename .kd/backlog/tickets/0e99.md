# Chat TUI auto-scroll broken + duplicate scrollbars

Recent fixes to auto-scrolling overcorrected — the chat no longer auto-scrolls to new messages, so the user has to manually scroll after every response. Additionally, there are two visible scrollbars stacked in the bottom-right corner of the TUI, suggesting a nested scrollable container issue.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New messages auto-scroll the chat view to the bottom (restore previous behavior)
- [ ] Only one scrollbar visible — fix the nested VerticalScroll / scrollable container overlap
- [ ] Manual scroll-up should still pause auto-scroll (don't regress the original fix)
