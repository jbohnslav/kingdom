# Chat council prompt: agents should engage with each other's responses, not answer in isolation

Currently council agents each answer the king's prompt independently, as though the other councillors don't exist. The chat prompt should instruct agents to behave more like a Slack thread: read and build on each other's responses, comment on prior points, debate or disagree where warranted, and synthesize rather than repeat.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update the council chat system prompt so agents reference and engage with prior messages from other councillors
- [ ] Agents should build on, critique, or extend existing responses — not just answer the original question in parallel
- [ ] Preserve the ability for agents to disagree or offer alternative perspectives
