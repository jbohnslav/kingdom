# Fix council subprocess stdin handling

Council members (claude, agent) were hanging on subprocess calls because stdin was inherited from parent process.

---

## Work Log

### Issue
`kd council ask` times out on claude and agent (600s) while codex responds quickly (27-30s).

### What We Tried

**1. Verified CLIs work directly**
```bash
claude --print --output-format json -p "Say hello"  # 1.8s ✓
cursor agent --print --output-format json "Say hello"  # 12.6s ✓
```
Both CLIs work fine with simple prompts.

**2. Tested with longer prompts**
```bash
claude --print ... -p "Review this design... [3400 chars]"  # 7.5s ✓
cursor agent --print ... "[same prompt]"  # 29s ✓
```
Both work with realistic prompt lengths.

**3. Checked for unexpanded shell syntax issue**
The prompts in metadata.json showed literal `$(cat .kd/.../design.md)` unexpanded (user used `<<'EOF'` single-quoted heredoc). But:
- Claude handles literal `$(cat ...)` fine — it uses tools to read the file (3 turns)
- Codex also handles it — responded with actual design doc content
- Direct CLI calls with literal `$(cat ...)` work in ~7-30s

**4. Checked session resumption**
- No stale sessions for claude/agent on this branch
- Invalid session IDs fail fast with clear error, don't hang

**5. Tested subprocess.run pattern**
```python
subprocess.run(['claude', '--print', '-p', prompt], capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=60)
```
Works fine (4.1s) — same pattern Kingdom uses.

### Solution Found

**Root cause**: `subprocess.run()` without explicit `stdin` argument inherits from parent. The CLI agents (claude, cursor) were detecting/waiting on stdin, causing them to hang.

**Fix**: Add `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` to the subprocess.run call in `base.py`:

```python
result = subprocess.run(
    command,
    capture_output=True,
    text=True,
    timeout=timeout,
    stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL,  # <-- this fixes it
)
```

**Results after fix**:
- Simple prompt: claude 3.5s, codex 5.3s, agent 6.6s
- Complex prompt (read file, give opinion): claude 8.7s, codex 4.6s, agent 38.3s

All three council members now respond reliably.
