# Council worker should strip trailing whitespace from messages

Council agent responses often contain trailing whitespace, which the pre-commit
hook catches. During the ticket-management-ux branch, this happened twice and
required re-staging and re-committing. The council worker should strip trailing
whitespace from each line before writing message files to `.kd/` threads.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `add_message` or the council writer strips trailing whitespace from content
- [ ] Pre-commit hook no longer catches whitespace in council thread files
