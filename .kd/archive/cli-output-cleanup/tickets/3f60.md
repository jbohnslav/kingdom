# kd tk move should default to current branch

`kd tk move <id> <branch>` requires the target branch name. When there's an
active run, it should default to the current branch so you can just do
`kd tk move <id>`. Discovered during agent-driven workflow — had to look up
the branch name every time instead of just moving tickets to "here".

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `kd tk move <id>` with no branch argument defaults to active run's branch
- [ ] Still accepts explicit branch argument to override
- [ ] Errors if no active run and no branch argument given
