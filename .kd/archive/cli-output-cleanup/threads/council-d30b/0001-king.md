Review the design doc at .kd/branches/cli-output-cleanup/design.md. We're replacing all Rich Panel usage with plain text/markdown output, fixing path display, adding file paths to tk show, removing 'runs' terminology, stripping trailing whitespace in council, and defaulting tk move to current branch. Key question: should we keep Rich Console at all or go fully plain typer.echo? Any concerns with the approach?
