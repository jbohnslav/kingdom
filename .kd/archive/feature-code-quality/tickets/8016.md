# Create pre-commit configuration

Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with hooks:
- ruff-pre-commit (v0.8.6) for linting with --fix
- ruff-format for formatting
- pre-commit-hooks (v5.0.0) for: trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, check-yaml, check-added-large-files, check-merge-conflict

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists with correct content
- [ ] `pre-commit run --all-files` passes
- [ ] Hooks use pinned versions per design
