# Configure Ruff in pyproject.toml

Add ruff configuration and dev dependency to `pyproject.toml`:
- Add `ruff` to dev dependencies
- Add `[tool.ruff]` with target-version="py312", line-length=100, extend-exclude=["third-party", ".kd"]
- Add `[tool.ruff.lint]` with select=["E", "W", "F", "I", "B", "C4", "UP", "SIM", "RUF"]
- Add ignore=["E501", "SIM108"]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `ruff` added to dev dependencies in pyproject.toml
- [ ] `[tool.ruff]` section configured per design
- [ ] `[tool.ruff.lint]` section with correct select/ignore
- [ ] `uv sync` installs ruff successfully
- [ ] `ruff check .` runs without config errors

## Work Log

- Changed line-length from 100 to 120 per user preference
