                  Auto-pull backlog tickets when starting work

When kd work <ticket> or kd peasant start <ticket> is given a ticket that lives
in .kd/backlog/tickets/ instead of the current branch, the ticket resolution
logic should automatically move it into .kd/branches/<branch>/tickets/ as part
of context setup. No new CLI command needed — avoids command bloat.

Acceptance Criteria

 • [ ] _resolve_peasant_context checks backlog as a fallback when ticket isn't
   found on the branch
 • [ ] Backlog ticket file is moved (git mv) into the branch ticket directory
   automatically
 • [ ] Ticket shows up in kd tk list and kd tk ready after being pulled
 • [ ] Error if ticket doesn't exist anywhere (backlog or branch)
