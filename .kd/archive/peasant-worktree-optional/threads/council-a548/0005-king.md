one difficulty is that my current workflow doesn't involve a lot of parallelization. I love the planning phase, uh the design doc iteration with multiple agents. And so on, and the breakdown into tickets. I love all that. the work tree peasants parallel work merge phase is like one step of autonomy beyond what I have been doing. and it would be great if we could have a way to make like each individual peasant works on one ticket in parallel be an option. And the other option is that I guess the hand or the coding agent that the King prefers, just does the work in series on the main branch instead of in a work tree. does that make sense? How would that fit in with our current design and workflow?
