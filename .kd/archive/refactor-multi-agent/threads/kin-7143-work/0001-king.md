# Starting work on kin-7143

**Title:** Replace os.fork() with subprocess.Popen in council ask --async

The double-fork pattern in council_ask --async is Unix-only and swallows exceptions silently. Replace with subprocess.Popen + start_new_session=True, matching the pattern already used by peasant_start.
