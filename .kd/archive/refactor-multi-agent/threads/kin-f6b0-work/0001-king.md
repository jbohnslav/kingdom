# Starting work on kin-f6b0

**Title:** Fix queued directives dropped on peasant restart

harness.py:287 initializes last_seen_seq to the latest thread message, so any king messages sent while the peasant was down are skipped. Should initialize to the seq before the peasant went down, or scan for unseen messages on startup.
