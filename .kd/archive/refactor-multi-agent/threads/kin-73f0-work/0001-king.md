# Starting work on kin-73f0

**Title:** Pass ticket file path instead of raw body in build_prompt

build_prompt in harness.py concatenates the full ticket body (including YAML frontmatter) into the agent prompt. Since agents can read files, pass the ticket file path instead and let the agent read it directly.
