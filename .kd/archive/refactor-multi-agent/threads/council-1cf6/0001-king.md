Review the smoke test worklog in .kd/branches/refactor-multi-agent/tickets/kin-41f9.md. Based on the issues found, propose updates to the design doc (design.md) covering: harness quality gates (should run ruff not just pytest), worktree setup (uv sync, pre-commit install), peasant log visibility, reject-relaunch workflow, and worktree  staleness. What should v2 of the design look like?
