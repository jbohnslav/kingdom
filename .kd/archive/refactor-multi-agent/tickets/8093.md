# Peasants must launch with no-approval override flags

Peasants run async in their own worktrees — there's nobody around to approve file writes. Without elevated permissions the agent blocks immediately on the first edit. Ralph loops solve this with `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`. We need equivalent no-approval launch flags for all supported backends.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `kd peasant start` passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to the claude backend
- [ ] Codex backend launches with `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` (YOLO / no-approval mode)
- [ ] Cursor backend launches with `--force --sandbox disabled`
- [ ] Peasant can write files in its worktree without blocking on permissions
