Review the design doc at .kd/branches/ticket-management-ux/design.md. We're implementing three ticket lifecycle improvements: (1) kd tk create prints file path instead of bare ID, (2) closing a backlog ticket auto-archives it, (3) new kd tk pull command. Focus on: are the decisions sound? Anything missing? Should kd tk pull support --all?
