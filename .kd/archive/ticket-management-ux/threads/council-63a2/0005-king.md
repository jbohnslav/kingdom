Review the implementation in the latest commit (git diff HEAD~2..HEAD -- src/). We implemented three ticket lifecycle improvements: (1) kd tk create now prints the absolute file path instead of just the ID, (2) kd tk close auto-archives backlog tickets and kd tk reopen auto-restores them, (3) new kd tk pull command. Check for bugs, edge cases, and missing tests.
