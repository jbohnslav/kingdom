# kd plan (Council -> plan.md)

Implement kd plan: use Council to draft/update .kd/runs/<feature>/plan.md as single source of truth with Goal/Tickets/Revisions; update in-place until dev starts, then append changes under Revisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

kd plan creates/updates plan.md in documented format; re-running updates in-place (or appends to Revisions after dev).
