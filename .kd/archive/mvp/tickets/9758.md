# Council run bundles

Write council output to .kd/runs/<feature>/logs/council/<run_id>/ with per-model Markdown files

## Acceptance Criteria

- Every council call creates timestamped run directory
- Bundle contains per-model response files as Markdown (claude.md, gemini.md, gpt.md)
- Bundle contains metadata.json (timing, model versions, token counts)
- Bundle contains errors.json if any member failed
- run_id format: run-<4hex> (e.g., run-4f3a)
- No summary.md or synthesis file (King reads responses directly)
