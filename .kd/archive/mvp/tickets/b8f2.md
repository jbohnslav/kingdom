# Update kd status command (basic)

Show normalized branch name, original git branch name, design.md status, breakdown.md status. Remove tk subprocess calls. Ticket counts added in separate ticket.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Shows normalized and original branch names
- [x] Shows design/breakdown status
- [x] Works with --json flag
- [x] No tk subprocess calls

## Work Log

### 2026-02-04
- Rewrote `status` command in `cli.py` to use new branch-based structure
- Added `_get_doc_status()` helper to check if design/breakdown is empty, present, or missing
- Shows both original branch name (from state.json) and normalized directory name
- Removed all tk subprocess calls (ticket counts to be added in separate ticket)
- Supports --json flag with structured output
- Falls back to legacy runs/ structure for backwards compatibility
- Fixed pre-existing test failures for gitignore pattern expectations
- All 146 tests passing
