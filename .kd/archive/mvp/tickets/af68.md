# Update gitignore patterns

Update .kd/.gitignore template: *.json, *.jsonl, *.log, *.session, **/logs/, **/sessions/, worktrees/, current

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New gitignore template in ensure_base_layout()
- [ ] Correctly ignores state.json but tracks design.md, tickets/*.md
- [ ] git status is clean after operations
