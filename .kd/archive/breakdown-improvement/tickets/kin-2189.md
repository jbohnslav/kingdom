# Create ticket tool and agent runner

New agent_breakdown.py module with:
- create_ticket tool with validation (title, description, priority 0-3, dependencies, acceptance criteria)
- Tool returns generated ticket ID for dependency wiring
- Agent invocation with design doc as context
- Collect tickets in memory before writing

This is the foundational infrastructure for agent-driven breakdown.
