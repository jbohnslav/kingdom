# Refactor kd breakdown command

Update the kd breakdown CLI command:
- Remove --apply flag, make ticket creation the default behavior
- Add --dry-run for preview-only mode
- Add --yes to skip confirmation prompt
- Read design doc, validate Breakdown section exists
- Call agent runner, display preview, confirm, write tickets

Depends on: kin-2189 (agent runner must exist first)
